				<h1>About</h1>	
				<p>I am a Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. As you can guess, I like to code things. 
				I also like to play video games, tinker with the piano, and watch cool shows and cartoons. </p>
				<p>Currently, I'm looking for co-op opportunities for the spring of 2017 (January-April).</p>
				<p>You can reach me by <a style="color:#EDA642" href="mailto:luoyang9@gmail.com">email</a></p>
